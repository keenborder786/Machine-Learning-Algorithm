# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Major Algorithms to implement different supervised and unsupervised Machine Learners

These files shows my journey of Learning Machine Learning. These are not an implementation of a final project but rather shows how I learned Machine Learning and then tried to apply those concepts.

These files include both sklearn part of implementation and also my own implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm.

Includes almost all of the main ML algorithms(KNN,SVM,Regression,MeanShift).
